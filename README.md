# ARM Assembly Project
#### By Cory Ferrier, Dean Fleming, Zachary Robinson, and Justin Sternberg
The [project.s](../master/project.s) file is a program written in ARM assembly that manually converts two inputted string-format signed floating-point numbers into single-precision IEEE 754 format, and performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on them. The goal of writing this conversion manually was to compare the performance of the manual version with the built-in floating point operations. After testing, our manual version reliably performs the operations faster than the built-in operations, but with some slight loss of precision.

For more information, see our [411ProjectReport.pdf](../master/411ProjectReport.pdf) file.
